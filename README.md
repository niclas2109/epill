# Technical Overview

This Java project is based on Maven and Webpak and uses spring framework and react.
There is a strict seperation between frontend and backend.
Currently you can choose between two profiles:
Per default ePill is using H2 database for development mode which is very comfortable when developing
locally. For configurations see:
	/src/main/resources/application.properties
		
When deployed to heroku as a running instance have a look at application-heroku.properties. When using
heroku profile ePill uses postgres database. For configurations see:
	/src/main/resources/application-heroku.properties

Frontend was developed using react and Webpack. Webpack-dependencies can be added in:
	/src/main/frontend/package.json
	

For changes regarding the frontend have a look at 
	/src/main/frontend/src/**

	
The frontend is built into spring public folder:
	/src/main/resources/public/***
	
	

# Initial Data
The initial data is inserted by executing sql from /src/main/resources/*.sql for
the respective, active profile.
For Unit testing use

	/src/test/resources/data-h2-test.sql.



# Executing in development mode
First ensure you have H2, Java 8 (or higher) and Maven installed
Open the fratcher project in you IDE (e. g. Eclipse)
Execute the project by starting FratcherMain.java


# Execute on Server
Ensure you have Java 8 (or higher), Maven, npm and postgres installed on your server.
Then just move the /target/demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file into your favorite
direction. You can execute this file from console with following command:

	java -jar demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
